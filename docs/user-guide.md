# User Guide - how to use the e-lab
Through this interactive section of the LifeWatch.be portal users can upload their own data using a standard data format, and choose from several web services, models and applications to process the data.

## Discover webservices 
This page helps you choose the right web services by **applying different filters**. For example, click on 'Marine', 'Taxonomy' and 'Aphia/WoRMS'. It will show you a list of services you can choose from to process your data.
