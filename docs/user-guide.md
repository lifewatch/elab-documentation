4. Preview screen
When clicking on "Next", you are redirected to the preview screen. Select the column names from the data format term that correspond to your columns.

The options "Latitude" and "Longitude" were selected from the data format term.

Preview screen

In the lower section of the preview screen, you can find information about duplicate or missing fields per requested web service.

Duplicate fields can occur in case of concatenated web services: the field is present in the original uploaded data file (the input file), and the field is also generated by a previous web service. Choose the correct field.

 

5. Results
Click "Start". The following message appears: Your results will appear at the top of the results table. The "filename" is the original data file you uploaded. Within the "resultfile" additional columns have been added to the original file, containing information derived from the requested data services. The "resultreport" gives an overview of the requested web services and any errors that might have occurred during the process. These files are linked to your account and can be downloaded for further analysis at any time.
