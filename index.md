The LifeWatch e-lab online application allows users to standardize, analyze and visualize their data, making use of web services built on top of internal and external reference databases.

A user can select several data services (taxonomic, geographic, thematic, etc.) and run them successively through a straightforward user interface. The LifeWatch.be web services can be used in a concatenated way, i.e. the output of one web service is the input for the next web service. Establishing such workflows helps solving (complicated) biological questions.

The use of the LifeWatch web services is explained in a user guide (this repo) and demonstrated in a few use cases.
